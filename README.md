### Overview

We are excited to announce the international conference **Exploring Reasons, Rationality, and Rationalism**, held at the **University of Zürich** from **10–13 September 2025**.

The publication of *"Reasons for Logic, Logic for Reasons"* (Brandom & Hlobil, 2024) marked a milestone for the technical and philosophical development of inferentialist logic.  
This conference offered a first collective take on the book’s reception and its potential operationalization across diverse fields, including:

- Philosophy of Language  
- Philosophy of Computing and Information  
- Philosophy of Law  

The event featured contributions from leading scholars and promising early-career researchers.
